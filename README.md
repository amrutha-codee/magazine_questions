# Magazine question submission
Hi everyone:wave:!!!

So you have taken up the challenge of solving this month's question. All I can say is "__All the best__ :+1:".

Some things to remember before submitting your response:
- Make sure to read the problem statement thoughtfully.
- The name of your file should be in the formate '_firstname_lastname_'
- Do be honest and submit your approach to the code, __not a copy from the net__.

The code will be judged on these criteria:
1. Clean code
2. Commits 
3. Readability and ease-of-understandability
4. Execution speed
5. Uniqueness
